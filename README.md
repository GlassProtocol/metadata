# Glass Metadata

Glass Metadata, is used for playing and monetizing decentralized videos. Instead of using a single NFT, a metadata file is used as the "atomic" unit. 

This makes it easy to work across different chains and allows for maximal flexibility for creators. The metadata is an extension of existing NFT metadata and is cross-compatible across different NFT platforms and contracts.

## Why is the "atomic unit" a file and not an NFT?

Relying on a singular file allows us to effortlessly remain cross-chain. Decentralized video is STILL relatively unexplored. 


What if a creator wanted to crowdfund a movie using ERC20's rather than NFTs. What if a creator wants to leverage solana instead of Ethereum. 


We opt for maximal creator flexibility. 


# How does the metadata work?

The metadata perfectly matches the required fields for NFT metadata. We just extend this metadata to work across various chains, and monetization forms. 

Glass Metadata is a superset of NFT metadata meaning that any glass metadata published will also be compatible as an NFT which gives a creator the opportunity to create NFTs later-on or even on a different platform / alternative creator-written contract.
